I’m Musa (“Musaxage”), a Web3-focused Python developer with a passion for Solana. I specialize in building lightweight Telegram bots and DEX safety tools that help traders detect:

🚨 Rugpulls (mint authority held, low liquidity, zero volume)

🎯 Sniper wallets (brand new wallets buying in)

🧠 Bundle wallets (creators linked to multiple risky tokens)


My tools leverage top data sources like Birdeye, Solscan, and SolanaFM, and run on Termux (Android) — ensuring easy deployment and low-cost hosting.

 I created ByteHoundBot, a Solana token scanner that scans tokens instantly via /check <token> and alerts users with risk insights—all within Telegram.

I’d love to help your team by:

Developing custom token monitoring bots

Auditing token safety for your users

Automating risk notifications in your community


My GitHub portfolio is here ➤ [github.com/musazage/ByteHoundBot]

Are you interested in a demo or trial? I’m available to discuss how we can strengthen your community’s token security.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Thanks,
Musa “Musaxage”
